## Hi there! 😁
I'm a senior at the Nueva School in San Mateo, CA. I love word puzzles, dogs, and pickup basketball. I'm of proud Korean and Japanese mixed heritage. I'm a patient listener with a good sense of humor. My pronouns are he/him.

I am a violinist, a researcher, a runner, a podcaster, a dogwalker, an inventor, a tutor, a cook, an avid reader, a cuber, a juggler, and Mandarin student.
